				<h2>About Me</h2>

					<img src="assets/images/Ben-Japan2016.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" id="profile-image">

					<p>
					My name is Thomas Mizelle. I am a graduate of the University of Central Florida with a bachelor's degree in Crminal Justice Administration. Upon graduating, I furthered my education by studying for a year at Florida A&M University College of Law.</p>

					<p>During law school, I worked for an established process serving company called Firefly Legal. Afrer stepping away from law school I chose to branch out own my own and began my own process serving company, of which, I am currently the sole owner and operator. I have been running my business for a little over two years now and again am seeking to further my education albeit in a slightly different field. I have always had a passion to learn about computers and how they work which led me to enroll in the UCF Coding Bootcamp. I am currently a candidate for completion.</p>
